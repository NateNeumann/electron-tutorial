This was created to be part of an Electron tutorial; you can find the tutorial [on Medium](https://medium.com/code-chrysalis/build-your-first-desktop-app-with-electron-2504b7214ec6), or in the /tutorial folder's README.

Development build with `npm start`. 
The app is easiest built for a stable user build with [electron-packager](https://github.com/electron-userland/electron-packager).
